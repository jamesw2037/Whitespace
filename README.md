# Welcome to Whitespace

To begin with let me explain why this exists. Whilst spending a lot of time building WordPress sites in previous jobs, it came to my attention that there seemed to be a lack in fully stripped down WordPress themes designed with custom manipulation in mind. That's where Whitespace was born. A simple, minimalist approach to a WordPress theme, allowing full control.

## Usage
Please feel free to download or clone this project and see what you can create with it, It is designed to work well with ACF and I would love to see where this Theme could be taken!

## Things to come

 - SASS or SCSS Support using GULP
